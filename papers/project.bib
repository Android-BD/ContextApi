  abstract = {Abstract. The recognition of abstract high-level activities using
	wearable sensors is an important prerequisite for context aware mobile
	assistance, especially in AAL and medical care applications. A major
	difficulty in detecting this type of activities is that different
	activities often share similar motion patterns. One possible solution
	is to aggregate these activities from shorter, easier to detect base
	level actions, but the explicit annotation of these is not trivial
	and very time consuming. In this paper we introduce a simple clustering
	based method for the recognition of compound activities at a high
	level of abstraction using k-Means as an unsupervised learning algorithm.
	A general problem of these methods is that the resulting cluster
	affiliations are typically not human readable and some kind of interpretation
	is needed. To achieve this, we developed a hybrid approach using
	a generative probabilistic model built on top of the clusterer. We
	adapted a Hidden Markov Model for mapping the cluster memberships
	onto high-level activities and sucessfully evaluated the feasibility
	of this technique using experimental data from two test runs of a
	home care scenario showing a higher accuracy and robustness than
	conventional discriminative methods.},

	should work out of the box across individuals, with personalization
	only enhancing its recognition abilities; and (iii) should be effective

  abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;A generic framework for the automated classification
	of human movements using an accelerometry monitoring system is introduced.
	The framework was structured around a binary decision tree in which
	movements were divided into classes and subclasses at different hierarchical
	levels. General distinctions between movements were applied in the
	top levels, and successively more detailed subclassifications were
	made in the lower levels of the tree. The structure was modular and
	flexible: parts of the tree could be reordered, pruned or extended,
	without the remainder of the tree being affected. This framework
	was used to develop a classifier to identify basic movements from
	the signals obtained from a single, waist-mounted triaxial accelerometer.
	The movements were first divided into activity and rest. The activities
	were classified as falls, walking, transition between postural orientations,
	or other movement. The postural orientations during rest were classified
	as sitting, standing or lying. In controlled laboratory studies in
	which 26 normal, healthy subjects carried out a set of basic movements,
	the sensitivity of every classification exceeded 87\%, and the specificity
	exceeded 94\%; the overall accuracy of the system, measured as the
	number of correct classifications across all levels of the hierarchy,
	was a sensitivity of 97.7\% and a specificity of 98.7\% over a data
	set of 1309 movements.},

  abstract = {Boosting is a general method for improving the accuracy of any given
	learning algorithm. This short paper introduces the boosting algorithm
	AdaBoost, and explains the underlying theory of boosting, including
	an explanation of why boosting often does not suffer from overfitting.
	Some examples of recent applications of boosting are also described.
	Background Boosting is a general method which attempts to \&\#034;boost\&\#034;
	the accuracy of any given learning algorithm. Boosting has its roots
	in a theoretical framework for studying machine learning called the
	\&\#034;PAC\&\#034; learning model, due to Valiant [37]; see Kearns
	and Vazirani [24] for a good introduction to this model. Kearns and
	Valiant [22, 23] were the first to pose the question of whether a
	\&\#034;weak\&\#034; learning algorithm which performs just slightly
	better than random guessing in the PAC model can be \&\#034;boosted\&\#034;
	into an arbitrarily accurate \&\#034;strong\&\#034; learning algorithm.

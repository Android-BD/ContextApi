  abstract = {Abstract. The recognition of abstract high-level activities using
	wearable sensors is an important prerequisite for context aware mobile
	assistance, especially in AAL and medical care applications. A major
	difficulty in detecting this type of activities is that different
	activities often share similar motion patterns. One possible solution
	is to aggregate these activities from shorter, easier to detect base
	level actions, but the explicit annotation of these is not trivial
	and very time consuming. In this paper we introduce a simple clustering
	based method for the recognition of compound activities at a high
	level of abstraction using k-Means as an unsupervised learning algorithm.
	A general problem of these methods is that the resulting cluster
	affiliations are typically not human readable and some kind of interpretation
	is needed. To achieve this, we developed a hybrid approach using
	a generative probabilistic model built on top of the clusterer. We
	adapted a Hidden Markov Model for mapping the cluster memberships
	onto high-level activities and sucessfully evaluated the feasibility
	of this technique using experimental data from two test runs of a
	home care scenario showing a higher accuracy and robustness than
	conventional discriminative methods.},

  comment = {NOTE: These notes were supplemented by looking at Liao's dissertation
	writeup of the same work.
	
	Overview: This is a supervised learning scheme done in several stages...
	the results from early stages are used to build the structure of
	the model in subsequent stages. Training is done for 3 people, and
	tested on a 4th person. For the test person, only GPS pings are used
	as input.
	
	specifics: * GPS traces from 4 people, 6 days per person * \~{}40,000
	GPS measurements per person * manually labeled all activities and
	significant places in these traces * used maximum pseudo-likelihood
	for learning
	
	hierarchical graphical model with 3 levels. top level: significant
	places (e.g. home, work, bus stop, parking lot, friend) midlevel:
	activity sequence (eg. walk, drive, visit, sleep, get on bus, pickup),
	bottom level: GPS trace (association to streeet map)
	
	* their typical GPS trace consists of approximately one GPS reading
	per second * GPS readings are segmented spatially; we have one activity
	node for each spatial segment of GPS pings ** e.g. a 12 hour stay
	at a single location is represented by a single activity node * if
	street map is available, segmentation is done in association with
	the street map (with 10m discretization) * "model can reason explicitly
	about the duration of a stay, for which dynamic models such as standard
	DBNs or HMMs have only limited support" [12,32]
	
	* two main groups of activities: navigation activities, and significant
	activities (in a single place, or at a transportation mode switch)
	* "to determine activities, our model relies heavily on temporal
	features, such as duration or time of day, and geographic information,
	such as locations of restaurants, stores, and bus stops." * "significant
	places are those locations that play a significnat role in the activities
	of a person: hoe, work, bus stops, parking lots typically used, homes
	of friends, etc...) model allows different activites to occur at
	same significant place; also, a significnat place can comprise mutiple
	different locations, mostly because of signal loss and GPS readings
	
	The CRF Model for Activity Recognition: 1) CRF for GPS denoising *
	break up street segments into 10 meter patches * measurement clique
	between each ping and all nearby street patches (Gaussian noise model
	from center of patch) * consistency cliques: put a Gaussian noise
	model on the \_difference\_ between the GPS displacement and the
	paired street patch displacement for consecutive pings * smoothness
	cliques: encourage street patch predictions to be stay on the same
	street, going in the same direction their conditional model for street
	patches given GPS pings is given in Eqn 26, bottom of page 10
	
	Output of the CRF model is taken as the spatial segmentation of the
	GPS pings... Hierarchical CRF is based on the segmentation, since
	one 'activity sequence' is associated with each sequence of points
	on the same 10m street patch * bottom layer of 3 layer CRF, now it's
	"local evidence" including: ** temporal information (e.g. time od
	day, day of week, duration of stay -- these can be discretized) clique
	functions are all binary indicators, one for every possible combination
	of temporal feature and activity ** average speed through segment
	-- discretized ** information extracted from geographic databses,
	such as whether a patch is on a bus route, close to abus stop, near
	a restaurant or grovery store; use indicator functions to model this
	information ** each activity node connected to its neighbors; e.g.
	extremely unlikely tha ta person will get on bus at one location
	and drive a car at neighboing location right afterwards (?)
	
	* Preliminary CRF\_0: just has activity nodes and local evidence nodes
	[notes from thesis] ** adjacent activity nodes are connected, and
	each activity node is connected to each 'ftr' with a pairwise potential
	** features are *** gps based: streetpatch, timeofday (first timestamp,
	discretized into Moring, Noon, AFternoon, Evening, Night), dayofweek,
	duration, *** geo database: nearrestaurant, nearstore, nearbusstop,
	onbusroute [latter extracted from geographic databaddses] *** average
	speed thru segment (discretized - 'to allow multimodality')
	
	* Significant Places [from thesis] ** from the MAP activity sequence,
	they then (by hand? they refer to an IsSignificant() function) associate
	each activity with whether or not it belongs to a significant place
	(e.g. transport does not connect to a significant place, while getting
	on / off a bus does ...); * spatial clustering performed on the locations
	of significant places * the cluster centers are the 'signiciant plces'
	* edge between each place label and each activity label in its vicinity
	* NOTE: the 'place nodes' are not dynamic; we find K lat,longs that
	are the locations of the significant places; what we still ned to
	infer are the labels for these significant places; e.g. several of
	the lat,longs can be 'shopping', or 'friend's house, etc... certain
	place labels are associated with certain types of activities * they
	want to also add features that count the number of 'home', 'workplace',
	etc., labels that are used. However, this requires making a clique
	containing all the places, which can be quite large...
	
	generate\_places algorithm: * really not clear -- clustering places
	associated with the same activity? how can you get any confidence
	in the activities?
	
	* Each place (node at the top level of 3 level CRF) connects to all
	activities that seem to occur in the same place -- built into the
	structure of the model * multiple activities may occur at the same
	place
	
	* each GPS associated with a 10m patch on a street edge * [20] inference
	using loopy belief propagation, and parameter learning using pseudo-likelihoodreferences

	AdaBoost, and explains the underlying theory of boosting, including
	an explanation of why boosting often does not suffer from overfitting.
	Some examples of recent applications of boosting are also described.
	Background Boosting is a general method which attempts to \&\#034;boost\&\#034;
	the accuracy of any given learning algorithm. Boosting has its roots
	in a theoretical framework for studying machine learning called the
	\&\#034;PAC\&\#034; learning model, due to Valiant [37]; see Kearns
	and Vazirani [24] for a good introduction to this model. Kearns and
	Valiant [22, 23] were the first to pose the question of whether a
	\&\#034;weak\&\#034; learning algorithm which performs just slightly
	better than random guessing in the PAC model can be \&\#034;boosted\&\#034;
	into an arbitrarily accurate \&\#034;strong\&\#034; learning algorithm.
